Original repo is
http://git.insignal.co.kr/insignal/arndale_octa-jb_mr1.1/android/hardware/samsung_slsi/openmax/?h=arndale_octa-jb_mr1.1

I'm trying to port CyanogenMod 11.0 to Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (SM-N900)

This repo needs to be merged with CyanogenMod's android_hardware_samsung_slsi_openmax.

But they has some differences (conflicts) and I skipped merge for some time.
Original CM repo didn't work for me.
